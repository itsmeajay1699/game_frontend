## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to frontend and install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:

```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

3. Start the development server:

## 💸 Payout Logic

This slot machine uses a **weighted symbol system** to simulate spin outcomes and determine player payouts.

### 🧩 Symbol Setup

Each symbol has:

- **`id`** – unique identifier (e.g., `"cherry"`, `"joker"`)
- **`weight`** – probability of appearing (higher weight ⇒ more common)
- **`payout`** – multiplier applied to the wager on a 3-symbol match
- **`index`** – position used by the frontend animation

```typescript
export const ReelOne: Symbol[] = [
  { id: "cherry",     weight:  8, payout:  8, index: 0 },
  { id: "orange",     weight: 40, payout:  2, index: 4 },
  { id: "watermelon", weight: 30, payout:  3, index: 5 },
  { id: "ring",       weight: 15, payout:  5, index: 1 },
  { id: "seven",      weight:  5, payout: 10, index: 3 },
  { id: "joker",      weight:  2, payout: 20, index: 2 },
];

🎯 Weighted Random Symbol Selection
Symbols are chosen with a weighted-random algorithm:

export function getWeightedSymbol(symbols: Symbol[]): Symbol {
  const totalWeight = symbols.reduce((sum, sym) => sum + sym.weight, 0);
  const rand = Math.random() * totalWeight;

  let cumulative = 0;
  for (const symbol of symbols) {
    cumulative += symbol.weight;
    if (rand < cumulative) return symbol;
  }

  throw new Error("No symbol selected – check weights");
}


Higher weight ⇒ more likely to appear.

Lower weight ⇒ rarer but offers higher payouts.

💰 Payout Rules
Three matching symbols → player wins.

Payout formula


payout = wagerAmount * symbol.payout;


Two matching symbols → partial win (to be implemented).

No match → player loses wager.

Example
Wager	Matching Symbol	Multiplier	Total Win
₹30	ring	5×	₹150
₹10	joker	20×	₹200


```
